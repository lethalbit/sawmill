# Sawmill

Sawmill is a framework for instrumenting C++ applications to collect structured event-based diagnostic information, much in the same way that the [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) [tracing](https://tracing.rs/tracing/index.html) library does for rust.


To get aquatinted with how Sawmill is structured see the [introduction](./introduction.md) page explaining the theory of operation as well as core concepts.

For instructions on building Sawmill, see the "[Building Sawmill](./building.md)" section.
